      <p>I write this information about myself in the hopes that it will provide people the information about myself that i feel will be most relavant towards you finding information that you need in order to make me part of your team. With that, my coding career started in late 2019, at the ripe age of 19 years old. I found that i enjoyed the software development aspect more than what i was previously focused on (information security). To this day, my coding language repetoir is very limited, only knowing basics of HTML and CSS, and a decent grasp of JavaScript. Despite my small grasp on all different languages, I do have many other traits that would be highly valued towards a team. Of these would be my enthusiasm, and ability to work with a team, and work ethic above all. I have always been very excited about things that i am passionate about, and coding is just like everything else in that aspect for me. As for my ability to work with a team, I currently work with a team at my job, along with i have played team sports throughout my entire life and therefore have a good grasp on how to deal with confrontations and things of that nature. Finally, my work ethic is really difficult to beat if im being brutally honest. I did my entire highschool education online whichh meant i was  essentially teaching myself the majority of the content, I also am a very early riser, as i can do most my work uninteruppted before most people even are awake for the day. For as long as i can remember, my family has shown me that the only way you can get to your goals is by working harder than everyone else, and that is what i plan to do with Software Development, and part of the reason i may be one of the younger candidates that you have applying for a job. I can promise that my skillset is broadening by the day, and despite my young age i can pull more than my own weight. </p>
